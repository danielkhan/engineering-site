Dynatrace's research in the area of distributed data platforms is a result for the ever increasing need to ingest millions of metrics, logs, events and tracing data in a scalable, resource-efficient manner. While also not disregarding the need that consumers of the stored data should be able to query it in near-real time. To accomplish these goals, distributed data platform research will focus on:​

## Fundamental Research

The balance of high ingest volume while maintaining fast query times requires research into data compression algorithms, and data indexing algorithms. Data structures that can be stored efficiently on disk without losing data quality. All this in combination with software architectures that allow linear scalability to any kind of load. 

## Technology research

New technologies need to be evaluated regarding their relevance and applicability for distributed data platforms, in order to make the correct architectural decisions​
