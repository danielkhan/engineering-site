An increasing number of software systems today are very-large-scale
software systems (VLSS) with decentralized control; support for multiple
platforms; inherently conflicting requirements; continuous evolution and
deployment; as well as heterogeneous, inconsistent, and changing
elements. The Christian Doppler Laboratory for Monitoring and Evolution
of Very-Large-Scale Software Systems (2013-2020) the lab has been
working on theoretical foundations as well as methods, tools, and
infrastructures for managing and supporting the monitoring and evolution
of VLSS (http://mevss.jku.at). The laboratory has been hosted by Johannes 
Kepler University Linz and was co-funded by the Christian Doppler Research 
Association, Primetals Technologies, KEBA AG, and Dynatrace Austria.
