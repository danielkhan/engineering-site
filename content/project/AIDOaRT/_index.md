AI-augmented automation for efficient DevOps, a model-based framework for continuous development At RunTime in cyber-physical systems.

Nowadays, modern systems in the domains of Industry 4.0, health care, autonomously driving cars or smart grids are examples of highly communicating (embedded) systems where software enables increasingly advanced functionality. The growing complexity of these Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) poses several challenges throughout all system design, development and analysis phases, but also during their deployment, actual usage and future maintenance.

Many leading companies have started envisioning the productivity boost of tomorrow to be brought by the application of full-blown AI (Artificial Intelligence) principles and techniques. As Gartner reported in 2019 , 40% of Infrastructure & Operations teams will use AI-augmented guidance and automation in large enterprises by 2023, thus resulting in higher IT productivity. Nowadays, more and more companies are already deploying AI in some specific parts of their businesses, or at least testing it in the context of proofs of concept or (often limited) internal trials. Notably, several operators are currently experimenting with such technologies on their own or in direct collaboration with particular suppliers. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any general and reusable AI-augmented approach intending to support full continuous software and system engineering processes in  the context of different use cases and application domains.
Indeed, AI for IT operations (AIOps)  can evolve over the upcoming years beyond Gartner's vision by enabling DevOps to embrace the scale and speed of latest state-of-the-art practices. By means of AIOps, we can reimagine the DevOps pipeline through continuous monitoring, alerting and (re)mediation in a secure and reliable way. To this end, AIOps not only uses data science and computational techniques to guide and automate (when relevant) operational tasks, but it also ingests metrics and uses inference models to extract actionable insights from data in order to contribute to an improved support for continuous deployment and operations management.
The major goal of AIDOaRT is to provide a model-based framework to more efficiently support the continuous software and system engineering of CPSs and CPSoS via AI-augmentation. Complementary to the support for already existing systems of any kind, AIDOaRT also aimed at improving the continuous development of new modern CPSs / CPSoS.  
Overall, AIDOaRT aims at enhancing the DevOps tool chain by employing AI techniques, in particular Machine Learning (ML), in multiple aspects of the system engineering process (design and modeling quality, source code performance, testing coverage, predictive monitoring, just to name a few). According to the AIOps methodology, the toolkit should support 1) the collection and monitoring of both runtime data (e.g., logs, events and metrics) and software data (e.g., design models) as well as the management of their traceability (Observe), 2) the analysis of both these historical and real time data (Analyze) and 3) the guidance for and automation of (when relevant) design and development operations (Automate). Thanks to the application of advanced Modeling / MDE principles and techniques, all data coming from these heterogeneous sources will be processed, collected, traced and analyzed in a more homogeneous way (e.g., by relying on a common shared repository) so that it can then be made available to all the AI-based improvement services that require it.

The project aims at using AIOps to provide aiding decision/process tools and support the various system engineering tasks. Furthermore, AI technological innovations have to ensure that systems are designed responsibly and contribute to our trust in their behaviour (in terms of both accountability and explainability ), e.g., as promoted by the Ethics Guidelines from the High Level Group of AI . 	 

Thanks to the provided capabilities, AIDOaRT wants to impact organizations where continuous deployment and operations management are standard operating procedures. DevOps teams may use the AIDOaRT framework to analyze event streams (for real-time and historical data) together with the design information (e.g., in different system models) in order to extract meaningful insights for system continuous improvement, to drive faster deployments and foster better collaboration, and to reduce downtime with proactive detection. We expect an industrial uptake of AIDOaRT technologies on the development of complex systems that scales up to real systems demand with relevance for all critical applications.
